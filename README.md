<b>Project: Awesome Usage Monitor</b><br>
Original repository location: github.com/psu-epl/Capstones-LID_Tracking<br><br>

Overview:<br>
<ul>
This was a senior capstone project that was done for the EPL-LID maker space at Portland State University. The goal of the project was to create a system that would log tool usage in the space as well as monitor and resitrict tool access, as necessary, if a user had not received training on the tool yet. The project was done over a 6 month period from Jan-June 2017. The team did not have a signed contract with the sponsor to begin work until Jan 30th, so total time from start to completion was 5 months. A group of 4 people took responsibility for different areas of the project and worked as a team to create a database, web interface, tool power disruptor, and testing software. I was responsible for software testing. This included creating the testing environment, automated unit tests, and coverage reports. </ul>
